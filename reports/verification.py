"""
SafeSpace — File Report anti-abuse rules: identity verification, a cooldown
between submissions, and an automatic lockout for rapid-fire filing.

Three independent checks, all enforced in ReportListCreateView.create():

  1. Identity verification (verification_required / has_valid_verification):
     required on a citizen's first-ever report, and again if it's been more
     than REVERIFY_AFTER_DAYS since their last one — a dormant account
     suddenly filing again is exactly the case a hijacked/shared account
     looks like. Cleared by ReportVerifyCodeView, consumed (deleted) once
     the gated report actually goes through.
  2. Cooldown (cooldown_remaining): a citizen can't file back-to-back
     reports faster than COOLDOWN_HOURS apart.
  3. Abuse lockout (check_and_apply_abuse_lockout): filing
     ABUSE_MAX_REPORTS within ABUSE_WINDOW_HOURS disables the account
     automatically (is_active=False, same flag Manage Accounts' Disable
     User button controls) and emails the citizen to reset their password —
     an admin has to manually re-enable the account from there afterward.

"""
SafeSpace — failed-login lockout. Guessing a password gets an account locked
for a while after MAX_FAILED_LOGINS wrong attempts, and the owner is emailed so
they know someone has been trying.

Enforced in CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer.validate(). The lock is temporary
(LOCKOUT_MINUTES) rather than an is_active=False disable that needs an admin to
undo — otherwise anyone who knows an email could lock that person out
indefinitely, including the Administrator. The owner can also clear it sooner
by completing Forgot Password (see PasswordResetConfirmSerializer), since that
proves they control the email.

This protects one account from guessing. It does not stop one attacker trying
a few passwords each across many accounts — that needs per-IP throttling.
